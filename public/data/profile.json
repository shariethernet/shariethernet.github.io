  "bio": [
    "My core expertise lies in machine learning hardware accelerators, domain-specific architectures (CORDIC, FFT, algorithm-specific), and advanced computer architecture.",
    "My research is focused on workload-based power-energy optimization for efficient computing systems.",
    "I have practical exposure to the complete RTL-to-GDS flow using commercial EDA tools, FPGA emulation, and post-silicon validation, demonstrated through my Compute-Near-Memory test-chip taped out at TSMC-65nm.",
    "I actively contribute to emerging high-level HDLs such as TL-Verilog. Recently, I have begun experimenting with agentic interfaces (MCP + EDA tools) aimed at automating RTL generation, verification, and chip design workflows.",
    "I leverage high-agency and first-principles thinking to tackle any challenge—even outside my expertise—and consistently deliver quality, high-impact solutions."
